# Twitter-Bot-on-AWS
Created a surfing twitter bot that uses beautiful soup to scrape the surfline website and tweet the daily surf report. The bot also likes and retweets relevant surfing tweets.
The Surf Report bot can be found at https://twitter.com/SanDiegoSurf5
The bot runs on AWS lambda and code modifications are made directly there after testing on my computer, so the code here may not be the most up to date.
